# ML-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Prediction
The SEOUL bike sharing demand prediction project aims to predict the hourly bike rental demand for a bike-sharing system in Seoul, South Korea. The dataset used in the project contains hourly data on weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and other factors, as well as the corresponding bike rental demand.

The project uses various data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform the data, and several machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models. These include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, lasso, ridge, and elasticnet.

The project also includes feature engineering techniques to extract additional information from the data, such as creating new variables to capture the effects of weather and time on the bike rental demand.

## Findings:-
* Weather variables such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, and weather condition, as well as time variables such as hour, day, and month, have a significant impact 
on the bike rental demand.
* The Random Forest Regressor algorithm produces the best predictive model.
* Feature engineering techniques, such as creating new variables to capture the effects of weather and time on the bike rental demand, can improve the accuracy of predictive models.
* Data preprocessing techniques, such as cleaning and transforming the data, are crucial for building accurate predictive models.
